## Technologies Used
- jQuery
- Google Maps API (including Places, Geocoding, Autocomplete, and Geometry)
- Bootstrap
- Snazzy Maps

## How it Works
Between You & Me works by finding the midpoint between two addresses. Then it makes suggestions for places that match the activity the user wants to do. If anything looks good, the user can get a link to the directions and save the location to their favorites. For now, the list is saved in Local Storage, with the possibility of saving to Firebase in the future. It's mobile-friendly too!
